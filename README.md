This work was done during the summer internship at Automatic Control and Systems Center (CAS) at MINES ParisTech. In this repository, we:
- proposed an observer and a controller design for heterodirectional linear coupled hyperbolic PDEs using backstepping method.
- conducted the simulation of a pressurized drilling model using the proposed observer and controller
